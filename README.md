# MSAEUnet
1.Code for paper 'Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Ionogram Automatic Scaling'

2.This is the code used in the experiment in paper "Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Ionogram Automatic Scaling". The codes can be run with the dataset which can be downloaded from the website given in the paper.

3.The MSAE-UNet is proposed to increase the accuracy of ionogram automatic scaling. Correspondingly, a multi-scale attention-enhanced (MSAE) sub-network is developed which involves a spatial attention nearest up-sampling (SNU) module and several residual channel attention modules with multi-scale skip connections. They contribute to multi-scale feature fusion and augmentation of the learning ability for enhancing faint and elongated profile traces of ionograms.
